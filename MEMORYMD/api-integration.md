# API Integration Documentation

## VolumeVolatility API Implementation

### Overview
This document outlines the implementation of real API services for the VolumeVolatility component, replacing mock data with live data from the CoinGecko API.

### Files Modified/Created
1. `/src/services/volumeApi.ts` - New API service for volume and volatility data
2. `/src/components/dashboard/VolumeVolatility.tsx` - Updated component to use the new API service

### Implementation Details

#### 1. VolumeAPI Service
The VolumeAPI service provides functions to fetch and process volume and volatility data for cryptocurrency tokens:

- **getVolumeVolatilityData(tokenId)**: Fetches detailed volume and volatility data for a specific token
  - Returns exchange-specific volume data
  - Returns token-specific volatility metrics
  - Processes and formats data for easy consumption by components
  - Includes fallback mechanisms for handling API failures

- **getComparisonVolatilityData()**: Fetches volatility data for benchmark tokens (BTC, ETH) and calculates market average
  - Provides context for comparing token-specific volatility
  - Includes fallback data when API calls fail

- **Data Processing Utilities**:
  - `formatVolume()`: Formats volume numbers into human-readable strings with appropriate suffixes (B, M, K)
  - `calculatePercentage()`: Normalizes values for visualization in progress bars
  - `getTokenId()`: Maps common token symbols to their CoinGecko IDs

#### 2. Enhanced VolumeVolatility Component
The component was updated to use the real API data with the following enhancements:

- **Loading States**: Added skeleton UI during data loading
- **Error Handling**: Displays user-friendly error messages with fallback to default data
- **Refresh Functionality**: Added a refresh button to manually update data
- **TokenContext Integration**: Reacts to token selection changes
- **Improved UI**: Enhanced visualization with properly formatted numbers and percentages

### Type Definitions
- **ExchangeVolume**: Represents volume data for a specific exchange
- **TokenVolatility**: Represents volatility metrics for a specific token
- **VolumeVolatilityResponse**: Complete response including all volume and volatility data

### Error Handling Strategy
1. API request errors are caught and logged
2. User-friendly error messages are displayed in the UI
3. Default/fallback data is shown when API requests fail
4. Error information is provided to the console for debugging

### Performance Considerations
1. Separate API calls for token-specific and comparison data
2. Loading state indicators to improve perceived performance
3. Error boundaries to prevent component crashes

### API Key Management
The current implementation uses environment variables for API key management:
- `VITE_COINGECKO_API_KEY` should be set in the environment
- In production, consider using server-side API proxies to protect API keys

## SocialSentiment API Implementation

### Overview
This implementation enhances the SocialSentiment component with a comprehensive API service for fetching and analyzing social media sentiment data for cryptocurrency tokens.

### Files Modified/Created
1. `/src/services/sentimentApi.ts` - New API service for social sentiment analysis
2. `/src/components/dashboard/SocialSentiment.tsx` - Updated component to use the new API service

### Implementation Details

#### 1. SentimentAPI Service
The SentimentAPI service provides functions to fetch and analyze social sentiment data:

- **getSocialSentiment(query, timeframe)**: Fetches sentiment analysis for a token/topic
  - Returns overall sentiment score and label (positive/negative/neutral)
  - Provides entity-specific sentiment breakdowns
  - Returns relevant tweets with engagement metrics
  - Includes mention counts by sentiment category
  - Supports different time periods (24h, 7d, 30d)

- **getSocialMetrics(token, timeframe)**: Fetches engagement and metrics data
  - Returns mention counts and trends over time
  - Provides engagement rates and social dominance metrics
  - Returns related topics with relevance weights
  - Includes trending score for popularity assessment

- **Mock Data Generation**: For development and fallback purposes
  - `generateMockSentimentData()`: Creates realistic sentiment analysis with deterministic variation
  - `generateMockMetrics()`: Generates metrics data with deterministic patterns
  - Mock data reacts to token symbol with appropriate variance for testing

#### 2. Enhanced SocialSentiment Component
The component was significantly enhanced with the following features:

- **Composite State Management**: Uses a structured state object to manage complex data
- **Timeframe Controls**: Added period selection (24h, 7d, 30d) with UI indicators
- **Concurrent API Calls**: Fetches sentiment and metrics data in parallel
- **Enhanced Visualizations**:
  - Sentiment score meter with color-coded indicators
  - Sentiment breakdown with category percentages
  - Entity analysis with individual sentiment scores
  - Social metrics dashboard with key performance indicators
  - Related topics visualization with weighted relevance
- **Improved Tweet Feed**:
  - Enhanced auto-scrolling functionality
  - Expandable tweet details
  - Engagement metrics display
  - Relative time formatting

### Type Definitions
- **SocialSentimentResponse**: Complete sentiment analysis with tweets and entity data
- **SocialMetricsResponse**: Social engagement metrics and trending data
- **SentimentState**: Component-level state for managing UI and data

### Error Handling Strategy
1. API errors are caught with appropriate messaging
2. Component displays loading states during data fetching
3. Fallback to deterministic mock data when API calls fail
4. Detailed error logging to console for debugging

### Performance Considerations
1. Parallel API requests with Promise.all for faster loading
2. State management optimized for minimal re-renders
3. Component uses conditional rendering for efficient updates
4. Auto-scrolling tweet feed with performance optimizations

### Next Steps
1. Integrate with a real sentiment analysis API
2. Add caching for recently viewed tokens
3. Implement rate limiting for API calls
4. Add more advanced visualizations (sentiment trends over time)
5. Create more sophisticated entity analysis
6. Implement comparison capabilities between tokens
