# Active Context

## What I'm working on now
- Setting up the BrowserTools MCP server from github.com/AgentDeskAI/browser-tools-mcp
- Adding the server configuration to cline_mcp_settings.json
- I will demonstrate the server's capabilities once installed

## Recent changes

- Documented product context

## Next steps
1. Read the current cline_mcp_settings.json to understand its structure
2. Create the directory for the new MCP server
3. Install the BrowserTools MCP server
4. Configure the server in cline_mcp_settings.json
5. Demonstrate one of the server's tools
